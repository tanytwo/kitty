                                    <h1>Interest in IT</h1>
                                    </div>
                                    <p>My interest in IT started during my last few years of high school, with the stem of my interest coming from the childish dream of becoming a game or character designer. As I became increasingly involved with one of the most played online games ever, League of Legends, my interest in technology and design fluctuated. </p>
                                    <p>During VCE I did Visual Communication Design and through extracurricular classes held by my college, I was able to experience basic and simple coding with the use of “Scratch” a free programming language. These events helped peak my interest into the world of IT.</p>
                                    <p>I chose to start my higher education at RMIT due to its accessibility and how friendly its community and environment is. I also have many friends who are already studying at RMIT and they can help guide and support me whenever I am in need.</p>
                                    <p>While studying at RMIT I expect to be thoroughly knowledgeable in the fundamentals of Information Technology.</p>

                                    <p>The job is basically a position for a UX Designer with several years of experience. With work revolving around developing and refining creative projects it sparks a major interest within me. The position requires immense creativity, several years of experience in the UX / Design industry, a great knowledge of IA and user-centred design, and prominent management, organisation and multitasking skills. With my current state, I am far from the ideal match. I will need to complete my degree and find experience in other jobs. Although, I am currently working for a small independent business as the designer, giving me small boost of experience. </p>

                                    <p>Creativity test (Test My Creativity): 75.34</p>
                                    <p>The results of each test show me that I’m an open minded and creative individual but also very emotional and driven by my own thinking and intuition. When working in a team, I believe that I may be able to provide a constant range of proposals, keeping ideas fresh and inspiring my workmates. However, my work flow may be easily interrupted by my emotional state and due to the unstableness of them. When forming a team I should take into account the people I am working with and try not to clash ideas and refrain from becoming disorganised from emotions.</p>

                                    <h1>Project Ideas</h1>
                                    </div>

                                    <p><b>Overview</b></p>
                                    <p>The project idea that I have revolves around making a 2D game with simplistic and minimalistic features. The game will be easy to understand and enjoyable for anyone, from people who are not heavily invested in gaming to casual gamers to hardcore gamers. The idea of the game will be based around a continuous and long running game or never-ending game to keep players constantly coming back. The project would involve a lot of designing and catering towards a user-centred design, making it clean and aesthetically pleasing to the eye would be one of the main objectives.</p>
                                    <p><b>Motivation</b></p>
                                    <p>The project will be interesting as many individuals are starting to get into the trend of “aesthetically pleasing” things and “minimalistic” designs. With the rise of technology, people are spending more and more time on their devices, even leisurely activities would be conducted on these devices. Through creating this game, it will capture the attention of many individuals through the game’s simple and attractive design and keep the audience through its intuitive gameplay mechanics.</p>
                                    <p><b>Description</b></p>
                                    <p>The game will be in a visually clean cut 2D style with soft colours and a minimalistic design, catering towards people into the latest trends of minimalism and modern representation. The game could potentially be a simple platforming game, a collection game that takes real time or a simple and repetitive role-playing game. </p>
                                    <p><b>Tools & Technology</b></p>
                                    <p>Software and hardware needed for the development of this project would include any type of personal computer or laptop and a gaming developing tool such as Construct2. Other programs needed would be Photoshop for developing and refining art and designs for the game.</p>
                                    <p><b>Skills Required</b></p>
                                    <p>The skills required for this project would be the ability to understand and configure a simple game and the ability to design and create concept art for the game and be able to put them together into digital form.</p>
                                    <p><b>Outcome</b></p>
                                    <p>If the project is successful, the outcome of this project would be an enticing game for many. The game could be used as an easy way to kill time or a leisure activity.</p>
